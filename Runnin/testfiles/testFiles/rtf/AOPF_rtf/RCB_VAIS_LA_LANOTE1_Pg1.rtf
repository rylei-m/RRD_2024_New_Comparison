\pard\nowidctlpar\qj\fs20 Generally, individuals will be protected by the Louisiana Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association if they live in this state and hold a life or health insurance contract, or an annuity, or if they are insured under a group insurance contract, issued by an insurer authorized to conduct business in Louisiana. The beneficiaries, payees or assignees of insured persons are protected as well, even if they live in another state.\par
